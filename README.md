# Welcome to JovarkOS!
***JovarkOS is an Arch-based GNU/Linux distribution offering stability, usability, and speed, in that order.***

## Who we are:
#### Teens! All members of the JovarkOS Development Team are under the age of 18.
That means that if you are a teen, you most likely are eligable to help out as well.
If you would like to participate in development, please answer the following questions in an email to [lucas@lucasburlingham.me](mailto:lucas@lucasburlingham.me):
 - Do you currently use Linux as a daily driver?
    - If so, what is the output of the `uname -a` command? 
 - What is your favorite distro? 
    - Why? Be specific, but being a distrohopper is OK too.
 - What development/team environment are you familiar with? Can you cite where you get your ideas and development philosophy?
    - We loosely adhere to the [Agile DevOps philosophy](https://agilemanifesto.org), and of course, the [Unix Philosophy](http://s3.eurecom.fr/~balzarot/softdev/material/0_2_unix_philosophy.pdf).
 - Roughly, without giving too much information, tell us where in the world you live. 'Cause we don't want to force people to have Zoom meetings at 3AM.
    - We already have members that live in opposite sides of the globe. Make sure you tell us if you live in Antartica.
 - Describe why you think that you would be a good fit for being on the JovarkOS Development team.
    - Yes, even if you are just a GIMP designer. We need those too :)

## What is JovarkOS?
#### We're glad you asked. 
Simply put, we would say that:
`
JovarkOS is an Arch-based GNU/Linux distribution offering stability, usability, and speed, in that order.
`
*Sounds familiar, right?*


Thats right. We use Arch *(btw)*. Why did we choose this?
 - We are geeks, just like you. We love customizing our desktop, creating extensions for it, making it our own unique interface. 
 Cause we can do that with Linux.
 - Arch provides speed without lack of software. With access to the AUR (Arch User Repository), made up of user-contributed open-source software, it's one of the largest software repositories in existance.
